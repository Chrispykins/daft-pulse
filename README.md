# daft-pulse (a Daft Punk tribute)
A p5.js sketch made while listening to Daft Punk (it's also my first p5.js sketch ever).

## Here is what I want to do
* I want to create a Pulser, inspired by this: https://youtu.be/KOpvLGlgjyw?t=191
* Making the Pulsers react to the beat of a MP3 file would be cool

## Current version
You may check the current working version on https://rodjuncode.github.io/daft-pulse/.

* Click to **START**, then click to **SHAKE**;
* Double click to **RESET**.

## Wishlist
* I need to work on a separate branch to customize the code, so it can look more like the original idea of the video. The master branch keeps a general code;
* I want to add more controls to the published sketch, so people can play with it;
* This sketch needs COLORS;
* The default styles for buttons and controls don't amuse me. Maybe fooling around with the CSS file to make them look like the p5js.org page would be a nice idea;

## Damn bugs!
* Fix BUG#0001: for some reason, inner pulses have more noise on their generation. Ideally, the noise should be the same across all rings;

## PS 2
I am trying to use Composition as opposed to Inheritance as much as I can in this sketch. This is my first experience with a code so oriented towards Composition, so it made things really harder. I hope I can reuse the 'behaviors' created here on other sketches. As of now, Composition makes much more sense than Inheritance for me. Let's see what happens...

**UPDATE (jun-02-2020):** I need a break from functions... I miss object orientation :(
