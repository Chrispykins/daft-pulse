# daftpunk-tribute
A p5.js sketch made while listening to Daft Punk (it's also my first p5.js sketch ever).


## Here is what I want to do
* I want to create a Pulser, inspired by this: https://youtu.be/KOpvLGlgjyw?t=191
* Making the Pulsers react to the beat of a MP3 file would be cool

## Current version
You may check the current working version on https://rodjuncode.github.io/daftpunk-tribute/

## ROADMAP (updated on jun-02-2020)
* I need to work on a separate branch to customize the code, so it can look more like the original idea of the video. The master branch keeps a general code;
* Fix BUG#0001: for some reason, inner pulses have more noise on their generation. Ideally, the noise should be the same across all rings;

## PS 2
I am trying to use Composition as opposed to Inheritance as much as I can in this sketch. This is my first experience with a code so oriented towards Composition, so it made things really harder. I hope I can reuse the 'behaviors' created here on other sketches. As of now, Composition makes much more sense than Inheritance for me. Let's see what happens...

**UPDATE (jun-02-2020):** I need a break... my next sketch will aim a more "classic" object orientation :(
