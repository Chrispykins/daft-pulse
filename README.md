# daftpunk-tribute
A p5.js sketch made while listening to Daft Punk (it's also my first p5.js sketch ever).


## Here is what I want to do
* I want to create a Pulser, inspired by this: https://youtu.be/KOpvLGlgjyw?t=191
* Making the Pulsers react to the beat of a MP3 file would be cool

## PS 2
I am trying to use Composition as opposed to Inheritance as much as I can in this sketch. This is my first experience with a code so oriented towards Composition, so it made things really harder. I hope I can reuse the 'behaviors' created here on other sketches. As of now, Composition makes much more sense than Inheritance for me. Let's see what happens...
